/**
 * DATATYPES:
 * 
 * Values in JavaScript can be organized by datatypes.
 * 
 * Datatypes can broadly be broken down into simple or complex.
 * 
 * SIMPLE/PRIMITIVE
 * Simple datatypes include:
 * Number: numeral values
 * String: collection of characters between quotes
 * Boolean: true or false to handle logic
 * NaN: numeral type that stands for not a number
 * Undefined: an undefined value
 * Null: the absence of value
 * 
 * They are simple because they are atomic and immutable. They do not hold, collect or aggregate other values.
 * Operations on simple values return new simple values. They do not alter the original value.
 * 
 * COMPLEX
 * Object: collections of key, value pairs { key: 'value' }
 * Arrays: collections of values as a list
 * Functions: perform actions on data and return them
 *
